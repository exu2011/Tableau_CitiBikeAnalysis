# Tableau_CitiBikeAnalysis
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you may merge multiple datasets from different periods.

We only have Tableau public version to work with by signing up for an account. I have downloaded CitiBike data csv files from this website
https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data
The database include monthly data since June 2013 to May 2021.  I havce downloaded May2019, May2020, May 2021, data for this analysis.  The idea is that May2019 reflects prePandemic rideship and citibike usage, May2020 reflect the impact of pandemic and closure on sitibike usage, and May 2021 reflects current and post-vaccination society and the usage.

My questions  are as follows:
What are most popular citibike station in New York in may, 2019 as a starting station  and as a ending station?
What are most popular citibike station in New York in may, 2020 as a starting station  and as a ending station?
What are the top ten most popular stations in May 2019 and May 2020?
What changes do we see between may 2019 to may 2020?

I have analyzed the count of start station and end station in 2019 and 2020, corresponding to pre-Pandemic and during Pandemic time.  I have found a significant increase in citi bike usage in May 2020 during pandemic in comparison with May 2019. This phenomena is consistent with social distancing policy and avoiding of public transportation in New York during pandemic. I have established two dashboards, one showing the visualizations of 2019 and 2020 citibike usage in start stations and end station, the second dashboard centered on citibike usage time by gender. I found that both men and women usages peak at a similar time around morning 7am and afternoon 5pm, but women usage increases disproportionately in 2020 during pandemic.  This is also consistent with more women were using public transportation before pandemic but during pandemic they all switched to citibike or drive in private vehicles.
